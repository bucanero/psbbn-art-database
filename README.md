# PSBBN Art Database  
**Game Image Count: 12,256 / 22,594**  
**App Image Count: 272**  

This is the art database for the [PSBBN Definitive English Patch](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch) project. When the game installer is used, all artwork downloaded from IGN is automatically contributed and uploaded here. Missing artwork is also reported. Missing game artwork is logged in `missing-art-matter.log`, and missing app artwork is logged in `missing-app-master.log`. The goal of this database is to reduce our reliance on IGN for artwork and eventually eliminate it entirely.  

## How You Can Help  

### Submitting Missing Artwork to the Database  
If you’d like to help by submitting missing artwork, you can do so by opening an issue on this GitHub page and including the artwork you wish to contribute.  

Contributed artwork can be in any image format. There are just three requirements:  
1. For games, you must provide the Game ID for all contributed artwork, e.g., `SLUS_215.48`. For homebrew apps, you must supply the ELF's filename and a link to the project's homepage.
2. Images must be square.  
3. Images must be 256×256 or higher in resolution.  

### Contribute via Ko-Fi  
[PSBBN Definitive English Patch](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch) project uses [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to automatically contribute game artwork and report missing artwork to this database. A free only account provides a temporary URL for seven days and 100 requests. As the project grows in popularity, we're exceeding the 100-request limit every few days. A paid subscription costs $9/month or $90/year. Donations help fund this.
